# akamai_group

Use the `akamai_group` data source to retrieve a group ID by name. 

Each account features a hierarchy of groups, which control access to your 
Akamai configurations and help consolidate reporting functions, typically 
mapping to an organizational hierarchy. Using either Control Center or the 
[Identity Management: User Administration API](https://developer.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/identity_management_user_admin/v2.html), 
account administrators can assign properties to specific groups, each with 
its own set of users and accompanying roles.

## Example usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
data "akamai_group" "example" {
    name = "example group name"
    contract_id = data.akamai_contract.example.id
}

data "akamai_contract" "example" {
     group_name = "example group name"
}

resource "akamai_property" "example" {
    group_id    = data.akamai_group.example.id
    ...
}
```
