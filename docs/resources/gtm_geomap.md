# akamai_gtm_geomap

Use the `akamai_gtm_geomap` resource to create, configure, and import a GTM Geographic map. Geographic mapping lets you configure a property that returns a CNAME based on the geographic location of the request. 

You can reuse maps for multiple properties or create new ones. To configure a property for geographic mapping, you need to define at least one geographic map for your domain. Each map needs at least two definitions. For example, you can have one definition that maps a set of countries to a specific data center, and a second definition that routes all other traffic. 

~> **Note** Import requires an ID with this format: `existing_domain_name`:`existing_map_name`.

## Example usage

Basic usage:

```
resource "akamai_gtm_geomap" "demo_geomap" {
    domain = "demo_domain.akadns.net"
    name = "demo_geo"
    default_datacenter {
        datacenter_id = 5400
        nickname = "All Others"
    }
}
```
