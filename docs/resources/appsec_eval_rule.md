  appsec_section = "default"
}

// USE CASE: user wants to add action and condition-exception information to an eval rule using a JSON input file
data "akamai_appsec_configuration" "configuration" {
  name = var.security_configuration
}
resource "akamai_appsec_eval_rule" "eval_rule" {
  config_id = data.akamai_appsec_configuration.configuration.config_id
  security_policy_id = var.security_policy_id
  rule_id = var.rule_id
  rule_action = var.action
  condition_exception = file("${path.module}/condition_exception.json")
}
```
