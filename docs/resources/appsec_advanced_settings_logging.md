# resource_akamai_appsec_advanced_settings_logging

The `resource_akamai_appsec_advanced_settings_logging` resource allows you to enable, disable, or update HTTP header logging settings for a configuration. This operation applies at the configuration level, and therefore applies to all policies within a configuration. You may override these settings for a particular policy by specifying the policy using the security_policy_id parameter.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
provider "akamai" {
  edgerc = "~/.edgerc"
}

// USE CASE: user wants to set the logging settings
data "akamai_appsec_configuration" "configuration" {
  name = var.security_configuration
}

resource "akamai_appsec_advanced_settings_logging" "logging" {
  config_id = data.akamai_appsec_configuration.configuration.config_id
  version = data.akamai_appsec_configuration.configuration.latest_version
  logging = file("${path.module}/logging.json")
}

// USE CASE: user wants to override the logging settings for a security policy
resource "akamai_appsec_advanced_settings_logging" "policy_logging" {
  config_id = data.akamai_appsec_configuration.configuration.config_id
  version = data.akamai_appsec_configuration.configuration.latest_version
  security_policy_id = var.security_policy_id
  logging =  file("${path.module}/logging.json")
}
```
