# akamai_cps_dv_validation

Once you complete the Letâ€™s Encrypt challenges, optionally use the `akamai_cps_dv_validation` resource to send the acknowledgement to CPS and inform it that tokens are ready for validation. You can also wait for CPS to check for the tokens, which it does on a regular schedule. Next, CPS automatically deploys the certificate on Staging, and eventually on the Production network.

## Example usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "akamai_cps_dv_validation" "example" {
  enrollment_id = akamai_cps_dv_enrollment.dv.id
```
## Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `enrollment_id` (Required) - Unique identifier for the DV certificate enrollment.

## Attributes reference

* `status` - The status of certificate validation.
