# akamai_property_rules

The `akamai_property_rules` data source allows you to configure a nested block of property rules, criteria, and behaviors. A property’s main functionality is encapsulated in its set of rules and rules are composed of the matches and the behavior that applies under those matches.

## Example Usage

### Basic usage:

```hcl
data "akamai_property_rules" "example" {
  rules { # Default rule
  
    behavior { # Downstream Cache behavior
      name = "downstreamCache"
      option { # behavior option
        key = "behavior"
        value = "TUNNEL_ORIGIN"
      }
    }
  
    rule { # "Performance" child rule
      name = "Performance"
      
      rule { # "JPEG Images" child rule 
        name = "JPEG Images"
        
        behavior { # Adaptive Image Compression behavior
          name = "adaptiveImageCompression"
          
          # Options
          option {
            key = "tier1MobileCompressionMethod"
            value = "COMPRESS"
          }
          option {
            key = "tier1MobileCompressionValue"
            value = "80"
          }
          option {
            key = "tier2MobileCompressionMethod"
            value = "COMPRESS"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "akamai_property" "example" {
  rules = "${data.akamai_property_rules.example.json}"
  
  // ...
